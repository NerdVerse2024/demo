# demo
This is my first repository
i'm excited about it. 
i always wanted to be a bioinformatician or a genome analyst to bring change to the healthcare. 
i'm still not sure how to code, but with sheer will, i guess, i'll be able to pull through to get to my destination. 
This is again a demo session
